HashTable implementation:

The class Position will hold the position of the bucket array and the position in the linked listed of the token.
The class Node is a node in the linked list. It holds the value(the actual token) and the next node in the list.

The class HashTable has the method add(String token).
It works in the following way:
	-if the given token is already in the symbol table it will return the position of it(a Position object)
	-if not, it firstly adds the token into the table and then returns its new position.
